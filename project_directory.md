- Notebook1.ipynb contains the bulk of my work, it includes:
  - Data exploration and preprocessing
  - First level model training (xgboost, neural nets, and logistic regression)
  - Time/location feature engineering
  - Second level (stacked) model training (incorporating output from first models, and engineered features)
  - Feature blending (arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means)
- Notebook2.ipynb contains the code supporting my highest scoring submissions.  I found that my first model(s) (from Notebook1) was overly complex, Notebook2 simplifies applying lessons learned.
- ‘Leak_exploit_incomplete.py’ provides incomplete code I wrote in an attempt to take advantage of a data leak that was disclosed in the final days of the competition.  I did not have enough time to complete my implementation, unfortunately.  
- Readme.md provides info on the utilized packages
- The ‘input’ directory contains all of the files provided to competition participants, unaltered
- The ‘output’ directory (left empty to save space in my submission) is where my prediction/submissions are written
- The ‘preprocessed’ directory contains CSVs of features I engineered.  They took a long time to process, so the notebooks I submitted load the features from CSVs instead of processing them fresh (the feature processing code is provided, but is commented-out)
